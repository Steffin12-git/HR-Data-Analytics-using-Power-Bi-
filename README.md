# 👥 HR Data Analysis & Dashboard using Power BI

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on Human Resources (HR) data analysis. It is a **learning-based project** where I followed a Power BI masterclass tutorial to practice essential skills in data cleaning, DAX calculations, interactive visual design, and dashboard creation.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand how to import, transform, and analyze HR-related data in Power BI. It demonstrates how to build insightful dashboards for HR metrics such as headcount, salary trends, age distribution, and leave balances.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 🧹 Data Loading & Cleaning
- Imported raw HR data using Power Query.
- Removed nulls and corrected data types.
- Split columns (e.g., full name to first name).
- Created new calculated columns like **Age Group**.

### 🧮 HR Metrics with Power Pivot
- **Headcount**
- **Average Salary**
- **Average Leave Balance**
- **Cumulative Headcount Over Time**

### 🧩 DAX Calculations
- `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `CUMULATIVE SUM`, `IF`, `CONCATENATE`, `YEAR`, `DATEDIFF` etc.
- Used measures to analyze employees with leave balance > 20 days.

### 📊 Visualizations & Customizations
- Bar and column charts for job-wise distribution and gender breakdown.
- Line chart to show staff growth trend.
- Slicers for filtering by **employee name starting letter** and **job title**.
- Used **visual filters** to display **top/bottom earners** in each job role.
- Customized visuals with color themes, legends, axes, and labels.
- Utilized the **“New Card” visual** for KPIs like total staff and average salary.
